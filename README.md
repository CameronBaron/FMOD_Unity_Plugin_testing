# FMOD_Unity_Plugin_testing

Unity 5 project using the latest FMOD plugin to extend on FMOD's Rollaball example project.

As this is the first time using the FMOD plugin, there may be some processes doubled up or not even used at all while I was playing around with different tools.

In this scene:
- The player can move around freely, using the standard asset first person controller, and shoot blocks. The intention was to have the projectile make different sounds when colliding with different object (but time has slipped away from me).
- There is a control panel, it can play, stop, kill and step back and forward through a music event attached to that panel.
- Volume controls on the pause screen, accessed by pressing ESC, which control the fader level of different buses.

There are a number of things I would do diffrently if I had more time, but I am using this part of an application for an internshit at FMOD Melb which needs to be submitted by tomorrow.
In the future I would like to come back to this, as I learn more about the functionality of the plugin and see what I can extend/improve.
